The posts I will write will document my prior and current notions of development practice and will show the research, reflection and deliberate practices I have endeavoured. By the end of this module I will have gained the confidence and clarity to state clearly my aspirations after graduating from the course, what skills I need to improve on in order to achieve these aspirations and what medium I need to create to evidence my skillset.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 mx-2 mb-0 bg-primary">This week is the first iteration of the first sprint and will focus on getting oriented onto the course by reviewing the course structure, understanding the first module in greater depth and reviewing how good academic practice can be developed. I have been advised on a reading list that will state all the books that may be useful going forward in this module.&nbsp;<br><br>In the post that introduces the course it advises that the success of high-level academic studies relies on the ability to manage time effectively. The course is structured using the Scrum project management style and is divided into sprints which contain the weekly study topics. I have used this style to structure my critical responsive journal in reflection of the course structure, this enables a clear layout of each week divided by sprints therefore making it easier to read, navigate through and it also prevents a feeling of being overwhelmed knowing I can do each week bit by bit.<br></p>
          <h3 class="text-center bg-secondary p-2 mx-2 mt-2">Spark Forum</h3>
          <p class="text-left bg-primary p-2 mx-2">In this spark forum I was tasked with writing a post introducing myself and state my reasons for enrolling on the course. Alongside this I was asked to share an artifact or experience that has been instrumental in leading me to enrol. In short, my post stated the following: My name is Connor Orton, 27 from Nottingham, UK. I am an aspiring games programmer who wants a job in the games industry as said role.&nbsp;<br><br>I joined the course for several reasons. Firstly, the course would help me gain employment by achieving a master’s degree. Secondly, I would gain connections to other games and UX developers for networking. And lastly, because I want to further my indie games development knowledge and skillset required to make indie games. I achieved first class honours in my bachelor’s degree, and this led me to be confident enough to want to study further. I have published 2 games on the Google Play store, one which is currently being remade in HD at the time of writing this and the other is live, these two games contributed to enrolling on this course and gave me the enthusiasm to learn and improve on my skillset. </p>
          <h3 class="text-center bg-secondary p-2 mx-2 mt-2">Part 2</h3>
          <p class="text-left p-2 mx-2 mb-0 bg-primary">I watched two videos on the Waterfall and Scrum Agile Framework methodologies. I have learned that waterfall is a linear based project management methodology which relies heavily on documentation and planning before development starts. Very little user feedback is collected until the end and the methodology relies on taking the risk that the project will be at acceptable standards in the end. Agile on the other hand is an iterative approach to project management which relies on user input and feedback which is collated and collaborated on in Sprints and regular meet ups with the team, this results in the end project being better in quality. Comparing the two methodologies - ref here<reference about="" agile="" vs="" waterfall=""><br><br>I understand that is always best that good academic practice is used when studying on a high-level academic course as failing to follow the rules of this practice will result in a misconduct review. Failing to reference outsourced work or quotes will result in one of these reviews and credit must be given to the author or artist. Plagiarism, the act of copying another individual’s work is also not tolerated and everything I create for this project will of my own original writing or design unless otherwise stated and referenced. Any references or quotes that I use for this CRJ will be listed at the bottom of the page or annotated under the image with their respective sources to avoid any negative academic practices using websites like CiteThisForMe to help with the referencing process.&nbsp;</reference>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary mb-0">I was given a challenge task to create an avatar that represents myself using household objects. Below is the avatar I have created:</p><img class="img-fluid d-block w-50 mx-auto py-2" src="https://i.ibb.co/9pYW3Ft/Avatar.jpg">

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary mb-0" contenteditable="true">Gaming: I included my switch Joy Cons as the switch is currently my most played console right now. I love portable consoles, but I am a PC gamer mainly, having played World of Warcraft for the last 15 years among a mountain of other game titles. On switch I am currently playing The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles as I'm a fan of the Phoenix Wright game series.&nbsp;<br><br>Technology: The wires, cable ties, adapters and usb sticks all resemble the fact that I'm passionate about the latest technologies. The wireless earphones for the eyes are not to show I'm into music but because I wear earphones for listening to sounds in general and it's comfortable to not be attached to a wire sometimes, just one reason why I think it’s good to be up to date with tech.&nbsp;<br><br>Pets: I used one of my cat's (Lucifer) collar as my facial hair. I have 3 cats that I love to bits. They are Maizy, Rocket and Lucifer (pics to follow in order) I inherited Maizy and Rocket from my partner. I raised Lucifer as a kitten, so I'll always have that extra connection to him because of this.<br><br>From this challenge I have learned what objects are most important to me from my possessions and I have learned a greater understanding about myself. I did not consider that simple objects mean so much to me, but I’ve accepted it now. In future I will consider the additional items that I didn’t have the chance to use towards my avatar and consider if what they mean to me going forward into building a career.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary" style="">This week is centred around creativity and how it can be used in development practises. This week I will experiment with my creative approaches in a playful manner to understand the meaning of the word ‘creativity’ in a greater depth. I will solve problems using creative methods to improve upon my create skillset in the challenge scenario. I have been encouraged to approach the week more open minded and have been advised that even bad ideas can be useful when solving problems creatively.<br></p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary" style="">During this week’s spark forum, I discussed the times when I have needed to channel my own creativity. One event where I have had to channel my creativity is when I’ve had to design various menu concepts for one of my personal projects, Blight of the Rose, a 2D horror side scroller that is in development by my personal indie game development company, Fine Chap Games. One of these designs, the navigation menu, stood out the most and required more creativity for it to look right. Below are all 3 designs from concept to finish.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center bg-secondary py-2">Part 2</h3>
          <p class="text-left bg-primary p-2">Reading research provided by the course I have learned that in order to find creative solutions to problems or come up with ideas that are new for a medium such as a video game there are several creative thinking techniques that you can use for this. To summarize some of these techniques they are listed as follows:&nbsp;<br><br>- Brainstorming&nbsp;<br>- Mind Maps&nbsp;<br>- Round Robin&nbsp;<br>- Opposite Thinking&nbsp;<br>- Collage / Cut-UP&nbsp;<br>- Mash-up&nbsp;<br>- Crazy Eights&nbsp;<br>- SCAMPER&nbsp;<br><br>Each of these creative thinking techniques may be used as an individual or with a team. For making video games I have used mind maps and brainstorming but have not used any other. Going forward in my games development practices I will consider using more techniques for creative idea generation and this may result in a greater flow of creative features.&nbsp;<br><br>Having watched the interview of Simon Colton, a professor of Digital Games Technologies I have done some research on how AI is being used in video games. In July 2021 in an article by (Stuart, 2021) they state that the CEO of Sony made an interesting announcement, that the company will be collaborating with PlayStation developers to create intelligent computer controlled characters. He then went on to state that “Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning in which an AI effectively teaches itself how to act through trial and error. In short, these characters will mimic human players. To some extent, they will think.”. This explains that artificial intelligence in video games is about to get smarter and AI learning capabilities have expanded quickly. In the video game ‘Blight of the Rose’ which is in development by myself and my personal company there are plans to implement AI in my enemy units, albeit I have not gotten to the stage where I must write my AI but articles like this give me inspiration and want to further my knowledge in AI to make my game enemies smart like the ones stated by (Stuart, 2021). </p>
          <h3 class="text-center bg-secondary p-2 mt-2">Challenge Activity</h3>
          <p class="text-left bg-primary p-2">For this week challenge I have been given the task of selecting one or more ideation techniques, choosing an existing artefact and then modifying it in using these techniques to form an entirely new artefact. The idea that I came up with was to choose an artefact and change the art style to something entirely different to something you wouldn’t expect. My initial thought was to take a scene from the SpongeBob animated TV series and to change the kids cartoon into a horror TV show but after thought I decided it would be more beneficial to my industry practice to choose a video game and modify it to result in something different.&nbsp;<br><br>The video game I decided on modifying was World of Warcraft which I have personal experience playing so I have many screenshots of in-game scenarios. Before I could decide on what I wanted to change in the game I created a mind map to help me think about what makes up a video game to help me choose what I wanted to change. The mind map was created using https://www.mural.co/ and is featured below: </p>
          <h3 class="text-center bg-secondary p-2">Video Game Mind Map</h3><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="https://i.ibb.co/ft0Z48N/Video-Game-Mind-Map.png">
          <p class="text-left bg-primary p-2 border border-dark">My mind map depicting the elements that make up a video game.</p>
          <p class="text-left bg-primary p-2 mt-2">The squares in blue are the key elements of a video game that when changed it will transform the game into another whilst it remains as a video game. I decided on changing the art style of the game as I thought this might be the most interesting visually. I then created a mash up of all the potential art styles with descriptions to help me choose an art style to convert it to.</p>
          <h3 class="text-center bg-secondary p-2 mt-2">World of Warcraft - Mash Up</h3><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="https://i.ibb.co/Tqf64d3/Wo-W-Mash-Up.png">
          <p class="text-left bg-primary p-2 border border-dark">My mash up that considers other art styles that World of Warcraft could use.</p>
          <p class="text-left bg-primary p-2 mt-2">My mash up assisted in helping me choose what style of art I wanted to change the game into, the red boxes being my most interesting considerations and I decided on the pixel art style as this would keep the immersion and fantasy realism of the game. To achieve this, I used an image to pixel art converter known as Pixelator found here: https://ronenness.itch.io/pixelator to convert one of my screenshots that I took in-game to the pixel art style. I chose to use a generator as I’m not an artist and this is not what I excel in regarding games development. If I were to convert an image into pixel art again in a real games development scenario, I would hire an artist to do this for me as this would result in the best outcome.</p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">This week on my MA I will focus on ‘rapid ideation’ in relation to video games in preparation for the game jam in the following week. There are two rapid thinking processes for video games which are game jams and hackathons. Games jams and hackathons are generally the same kind of event where people come together and collaborate to create working software or hardware. Games jams usually have no pressure involved but hackathons are usually in the form of a competition. The result is the same for both events, to develop a new innovative product. There are techniques that will aid in the productivity and idea generation of a rapid ideation event and by the end of this week I will put these techniques into practice ready for future game jam and hackathon events. </p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">In this spark forum I was given the task of discussing my experiences of game jams or hackathons, if I have any tips for ideation and If I have any experience using prototyping tools. Unfortunately, I haven’t had any experience with game jams or hackathons so I cannot comment on any experiences, but I am considering attending the January 2022 games jam at Falmouth as I think it would be a good idea to network and improve my games development skillset (ref).&nbsp;<br><br>Regarding tips for ideation one method, I use a checklist application on my mobile phone for on-the-spot ideation to bullet point ideas for games that I want to develop. This has helped me formulate full game ideas and has led to me complete the development of my second game Pixel Pinball Arcade by bullet pointing all the main game mechanics and features. I use this method whenever an idea comes to mind, I note it down using the application and as a smartphone user I usually have the device in my possession most of the time. This however is only a basic ideation generation method and going forward I would like to use more creative methods. </p><img class="d-block mx-auto img-fluid w-75" src="https://i.ibb.co/qB7FT99/Ideation-Tip.jpg">

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">I do have experience prototyping in the Unity game engine. For my upcoming game Blight of the Rose, a 2D pixel art horror game, I have created a small 2D test environment which consists of a pixel art tiled environment with a door and crafting stations, these assets used to be simple squares at first but were replaced by first draft artwork. I use this environment to test the various systems I have written in C# such as my menu system and player movement. I also have a prototype of the player animation on a sprite sheet that I am using as a placeholder asset to build upon the movement system before final art is used. </p><img class="d-block mx-auto img-fluid w-75" src="https://i.ibb.co/mJCcT82/Test-Environment.png">

          <h3 class="text-center bg-secondary p-2">Part 2</h3>
          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">After watching a video by Giovanni Rubino on an overview of rapid ideation I have thought about a couple of game jams I would like to participate in. There are a couple that I would like to enter. The first is the Global Game Jam that starts 28th January every year and one location that is hosted is Falmouth, the location of my course. The event lasts 2 days until the 30th of January where the participants are given 48 hours to create a video game using rapid ideation. Global games jam details are located on their website at https://globalgamejam.org/ where it shows the locations it is hosted at. (put more info here about it)</p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">Another games jam that I am interested in which I couldn’t believe when first hearing about it is the Pirate Jam which takes place on a fleet of sailing boats at Thailand. The games development takes place on beach bars along their sailing routes for 5 hours a day for 7 days. This rapid ideation event is hosted annually and there has been 4 events that has taken place so far. As of this year the event is closed due to the Covid-19 global pandemic. The event is supported by Epic Games and other various companies. The website is at http://www.pirate-jam.com/ where more details about the games jam can be found. </p>

          <h3 class="text-center bg-secondary p-2">Challenge Activity</h3>
          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">For this week’s challenge activity, I have been tasked with reverse engineering an interesting aspect of an artefact and reverse engineer it to make a prototype using prototyping techniques. I have chosen to reverse engineer a video game as this will be the most beneficial for my development practices. I have chosen to make a 2D game in the Unity engine and writing the scripts in the C# programming language. I have chosen to recreate the arcade game ‘Stacker’ which is featured on arcade machines in pubs and arcades and recreate it into video game to be accessible on android mobile devices.&nbsp;<br><br>Choosing to recreate Stacker will be beneficial for me as a games developer as I will improve my skills as a programmer in the aspect of gameplay programming. The reason that I have chosen this arcade game to recreate is because in 2015 I released a game on the Google Play store called Dash and Stack that I developed with a co-developer and as of 2021 it has been removed from the store due to its low API version. Dash and Stack is an android arcade game that recreates Stacker with game mode twists such as the classic mode, and endless mode and many more. I have since made plans to remake the game in higher definition targeting higher API android devices to republish and I have been given the full go ahead by my previous co-developer to create every aspect of the game including the gameplay that I did not write in the original release.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">For the design of the Stacker prototype, I have created a digital storyboard of the stacker arcade game and how the gameplay mechanics work in general. The rules of the game are the player must stack blocks and reach the top of the grid without losing all of them. Depending on the position of the player the game will set the maximum number of blocks and movement speed. For my game this is called Classic Mode as it retains all the rules of the original arcade game but to put a twist on the classic mode, I have created a game mode called Endless where the player can endlessly stack blocks and increase a counter so they can achieve a high score. I have made this mode as its generally considered bad practice to copy a game in its entirety so to make my game unique I had to put at twist on the existing formula for players to find an interest in the game.</p><img class="d-block mx-auto img-fluid w-50" src="https://i.ibb.co/nkGsW2b/Dash-Storyboard.png">

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">Before being tasked with this challenge I had already created a main menu scene and have created the game board and in-game menu, which is everything apart from the gameplay mechanics.</p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">First, I had to make the blocks move and go out of bounds of the screen. I wrote a coroutine that fires a Raycast one block ahead of the first or last child depending on if the player is reversing or not, if the player hits a boundary layer they will reverse. I could have used triggers to track the collisions of the blocks, but I wanted to use a Raycast because firstly I don’t have much experience using Raycasts and it would be beneficial for my development process to get more experience with this element and secondly, I can control a Raycast more precisely than a trigger for example only wanting to gain hits in a specific direction rather than all around the block with a 2D box trigger.&nbsp;I also moved the boundaries out more so the player blocks can clip outside the grid like the arcade game as my main goal is realism. </p>
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <div class="row">

            <p class="text-left bg-primary p-2 border border-dark">Basic movement and reversing an the player block intentionally going out of bounds to promote realism.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary" style="">Next, I achieved stacking of blocks by having the next spawned block become the active player block and have each block child do a Raycast beneath them to check if there is a block beneath them, if not they will fall to the ground using a coroutine and play a lose animation like the arcade game. To demonstrate how I utilized a Raycast the gif below will show the debug lines that the ray fires in order to perform hit checks. Again, I could have used triggers here attached to the block to check when it collides with another block, but I wanted to stay with using Raycasts, this way my code is cleaner and more consistent.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center bg-secondary p-2 mt-2">Prototype: Result</h3>
          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary">I have managed to fully recreate Stacker arcade using a grid, blocks, Raycasts and coroutines. I have replicated the rules and the animations for a classic mode with plans to create an endless mode to create a gameplay twist to differentiate it from the original game. Everything has gone well but if there is one element, I would like to change it would be to rebalance the difficulty, as it stands the speed has 3 settings, a slow speed when you have 3 blocks, a medium speed when you have 2 blocks and a fast speed when you have 1 block. I think that instead of having it this way the speed should gradually increase making the game increasingly difficult the more the player stacks a block. Also, due to time constraints I did not manage to match up the lives of the blocks to those on the game menu and this is another element that I would like to change going forward. Overall, the reconstruction went well but for next time I would like to make the game more difficult and make it more featureful.</p><img class="d-block img-fluid pb-2 mx-auto w-50" src="https://i.ibb.co/T0XC7DN/Dev-Update-5.png" height="100
