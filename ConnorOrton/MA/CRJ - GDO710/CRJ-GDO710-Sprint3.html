Secondly, although the sound effects were generally suitable for the game some of them were not as according to some feedback, I received from a tester some sound effects such as the menu interaction sound did not sound suitable for the genre and was too harsh sounding.

Version control, also named source control is a method of tracking and managing changes to video game projects, software and more. Software such as GitHub desktop are tools that aid development teams manage changes to their project code over time. Version control keeps track of every modification in an online database and developers have the ability to reverse project version if for example they make a mistake (Atlassian, 2021).<br><br>I have used version control for all my games development projects and even to store assets for my company directory but before I knew about it, I used cloud storages such as Dropbox and Google drive and in doing so I often ran into conflicting errors when working in teams and this wasn’t ideal as it would complicate the development process. For every new game development project or project asset directory I will always utilize source control to best manage the pipeline. Upon learning the theme of this week’s rapid ideation, I will create a public repository using GitHub Desktop to manage its development.&nbsp;</b></p>

It didn’t take me long to realize that my only choice was to choose the first topic of COP26 as my first project had already taken its final shape and the only possible way I could refactor or remake it would be to recreate it in 3D, but I consider this out of the scope for the short duration of the rapid ideation session.</b></p>

There are some key topics that will be discussed by attending parties. Firstly, governments must show how they will keep global temperature rises below 1.5C.

Firstly, the main reason I enrolled was to gain a master’s degree as I hope that this opens new employment opportunities in the future as the enhanced skills and experiences from the extra stage of study are highly valued (TargetJobs, 2021). Secondly, although I have an in-depth grasp of how to develop a video game, I hoped that along the duration of the course I could improve my specialism as a games programmer by developing games with a genre I haven’t explored before to better prepare myself for the future in case employment opportunities require me to develop a game of a specific genre. Lastly, I would like to befriend other practitioners as it is important to network as connections can lead to referrals job leads, mentoring and practical training (Indeed Editorial Team, 2020) and I would like to work together in a team to develop an artefact to improve my team-working skills.</b></p>

Reflective practice can also help you to develop creative thinking skills, and encourages active engagement in work processes.”</i> (SkillsYouNeed, 2021) During my time on the course, I have realized the importance of reflection and how it affects myself as a game’s developer. Learning from my mistakes and being self-critical will make me a better games programmer by ensuring I write the most efficient and readable code possible to be successful in a future career as a programmer.<br><br>Since the start of the course, I have already improved my specialism as a programmer as I have created a tower defense game for android for my first rapid ideation project, a genre that I wasn’t previously familiar with and did not have any plans on developing in the foreseeable future. I am happy with the standard of the result, and I have learned how to write more efficient and readable code in the process. Also, the course has made me write more effectively in a reflective aspect by writing this blog. Being reflective has also had a benefit when I write code as I often criticize myself wondering if what I have wrote is the most effective way of solving my issue at the time.</b></p>

Affectively speaking, the results from this domain show that I have involved my feelings with my posts, most commonly stating how I feel about the results of my work and sometimes regarding the time scale I must complete certain tasks which links to the disposition domain. Lastly, the lack of interpersonal domain results show that I haven’t been interacting with others or listening to other people’s opinions as much as I should which concern me, and this is an area that I should improve on going forward in the course.</b></p>
