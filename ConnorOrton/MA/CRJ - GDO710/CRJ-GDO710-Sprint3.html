Secondly, although the sound effects were generally suitable for the game some of them were not as according to some feedback, I received from a tester some sound effects such as the menu interaction sound did not sound suitable for the genre and was too harsh sounding.

Version control, also named source control is a method of tracking and managing changes to video game projects, software and more. Software such as GitHub desktop are tools that aid development teams manage changes to their project code over time. Version control keeps track of every modification in an online database and developers have the ability to reverse project version if for example they make a mistake (Atlassian, 2021).<br><br>I have used version control for all my games development projects and even to store assets for my company directory but before I knew about it, I used cloud storages such as Dropbox and Google drive and in doing so I often ran into conflicting errors when working in teams and this wasn’t ideal as it would complicate the development process. For every new game development project or project asset directory I will always utilize source control to best manage the pipeline. Upon learning the theme of this week’s rapid ideation, I will create a public repository using GitHub Desktop to manage its development.&nbsp;</b></p>

It didn’t take me long to realize that my only choice was to choose the first topic of COP26 as my first project had already taken its final shape and the only possible way I could refactor or remake it would be to recreate it in 3D, but I consider this out of the scope for the short duration of the rapid ideation session.</b></p>

There are some key topics that will be discussed by attending parties. Firstly, governments must show how they will keep global temperature rises below 1.5C.

The practice of playtesting is the most known method when conducting games user research, a method where a group of players are observed playing a game and notes are detailed on their behaviour (GRUX, 2021). When gathering user research for my own game I will use plugins such as Google Analytics to gather anonymous data, ensuring that players will know it’s being collected, and will use the information to understand how my game is played and if I could use the data to improve features or gameplay systems.</b></p>

Examples of ethical issues include informed consent, confidentially and anonymity, identification, and non-traceability and so on.

I have connected with several other developers, and I have had them message and talk to me about their development journey also. There are several benefits for creating a LinkedIn profile. Firstly, it will create a positive first impression as employers forms an opinion before deciding on an interview. Secondly, recruiters can find you on LinkedIn as there are jobs posted on the website and not always on recruitment websites. Finally, LinkedIn is a great place to network by getting involved in forums and groups to meet like-minded individuals (Adeo Group Ltd, 2021). At the time of writing this I feel that I’m not ready to seek employment as I would like to further my skillset, complete my master’s degree, and publish more games for my portfolio but I would like to use LinkedIn more to gain more connections to increase my employment opportunities.</b></p>

I have learned how to develop a wide variety of game genres in both 2D, and 3D and I have improved my code writing skills from their guidance.
