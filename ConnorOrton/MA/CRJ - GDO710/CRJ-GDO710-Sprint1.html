The division of the structure is set at a sustainable pace which will disallow myself from burning out and will avoid technical debt, loss of personal motivation and commitment, if this was a real life situation in my own indie games company it could cost the team and organization money loss as signification investment would have been made for the development project so careful structure of project management is essential (Babb, Hoda and Norbjerg, 2014).&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary mb-0">I understand that I must conduct good academic practice when working on and submitting my assignments. The Falmouth University academic integrity policy states “All use of another person’s work or ideas must be attributed and the sources identified, including where you have paraphrased or summarised. You must make sure that you use the correct techniques for citation and referencing as outlined in the assessment brief.” (Falmouth University, 2020). In my writing and practical work which consists of image and asset creation etc I will ensure to cite the correct author or creator to ensure good academic practice and to give credit where it is due.&nbsp;<br><br>I will ensure that credit is given in relation to my games development practices where required as there has been many cases over the years of lawsuits caused by plagiarism of game content, one in particular being the 1972 lawsuit of Magnavox Vs Atari where Ralph Baer, inventor of the Magnavox Odyssey games console sought legal action against Atari for claiming that the Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell had copied Ping-Pong and in conclusion Atari continued to sell the game on arcades and home consoles while paying the licensing and royalty fees to Magnavox (Obias, 2014). This event is important to reflect on as a video games programmer and developer it is paramount that I do not attempt to copy or steal any content that I use in my game projects, and I will ensure that I will purchase the appropriate license for assets or them from the ground up to avoid any lawsuits for future practice. </p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary mb-0">On my various posts for my critical reflective journal that I will write I will reflect on my writing and practical work. The basics of reflective writing are to look back at something, analyse the event or idea and then think carefully about what the event or idea means for future professional practice (Hampton, 2010). Using these basics and taking a video game mechanic that I have written for example I will determine if there are more effective or efficient ways of writing the script differently and will apply these changes so that I can improve my skillset for future development practice.</p>

Firstly, the Talis Aspire Reading Lists will suggest the most important PDFs that are related to ideation, reflective practice, and agile management. There will be an additional suggested reading list on some weeks that suggest other PDFs to read relevant to that week’s topic.<br><br>I will read these books to not only improve my reflective writing capabilities but to also improve my skillset to better manage, design and develop video games as a game’s programmer. Secondly, being a student allows me access to discounts and free software which will be useful. One useful piece of software that I will use for creating 3D games is 3DS Max, a 3D modelling software that I can use with a student license for free so I can create various assets if I were to make a 3D game. Lastly, I have my peers that will give me helpful feedback and vice versa to get a second opinion on my work. There are other resources and departments I can utilize on my course but these highlighted are the most important elements.</p>

I have several reasons for enrolling on the course. Gaining Master’s degree will improve my knowledge in the field of games development and will help in opening up a lot of job opportunities that will secure a better future (Csit, 2021).<br><br>I achieved first class honours in my bachelor’s degree, and this led me to be confident enough to want to study further. I have published 2 games on the Google Play store, one which is currently being remade in HD, Dash and Stack, at the time of writing this and the other is live, Pixel Pinball Arcade, these two games contributed to enrolling on this course and gave me the enthusiasm to learn and improve on my skillset.</p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary mb-0">Gaming: I included my switch Joy Cons as the switch is currently my most played console right now. I love portable consoles, but I am a PC gamer mainly, having played World of Warcraft for the last 15 years among a mountain of other game titles. On switch I am currently playing The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles as I'm a fan of the Phoenix Wright game series.&nbsp;<br><br>Technology: The wires, cable ties, adapters and USB sticks all resemble the fact that I'm passionate about the latest technologies. The wireless earphones for the eyes are not to show I'm into music but because I wear earphones for listening to sounds in general and it's comfortable to not be attached to a wire sometimes, just one reason why I think it’s good to be up to date with tech.&nbsp;<br><br>Pets: I used one of my cat's (Lucifer) collar as my facial hair. I have 3 cats that I love to bits. They are Maizy, Rocket and Lucifer (pics to follow in order) I inherited Maizy and Rocket from my partner. I raised Lucifer as a kitten, so I'll always have that extra connection to him because of this.&nbsp;<br><br>From this challenge I have learned what objects are most important to me from my possessions and I have learned a greater understanding about myself. I did not consider that simple objects mean so much to me, but I’ve accepted it now. In future I will consider the additional items that I didn’t have the chance to use towards my avatar and consider if what they mean to me going forward into building a career. </p>
