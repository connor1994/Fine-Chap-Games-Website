The Falmouth University academic integrity policy states<i> “All use of another person’s work or ideas must be attributed and the sources identified, including where you have paraphrased or summarised. You must make sure that you use the correct techniques for citation and referencing as outlined in the assessment brief.” </i>(Falmouth University, 2020). In my writing and practical work which consists of image and asset creation etc I will ensure to cite the correct author or creator to ensure good academic practice and to give credit where it is due.&nbsp;<br><br>I will ensure that credit is given in relation to my games development practices where required as there has been many cases over the years of lawsuits caused by plagiarism of game content, one in particular being the 1972 lawsuit of Magnavox Vs Atari where Ralph Baer, inventor of the Magnavox Odyssey games console sought legal action against Atari for claiming that the Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell had copied Ping-Pong and in conclusion Atari continued to sell the game on arcades and home consoles while paying the licensing and royalty fees to Magnavox (Obias, 2014). This event is important to reflect on as a video games programmer and developer it is paramount that I do not attempt to copy or steal any content that I use in my game projects, and I will ensure that I will purchase the appropriate license for assets or them from the ground up to avoid any lawsuits for future practice. </b></p>

Secondly, being a student allows me access to discounts and free software which will be useful. One useful piece of software that I will use for creating 3D games is 3DS Max, a 3D modelling software that I can use with a student license for free so I can create various assets if I were to make a 3D game.

One event where I have had to channel my creativity is when I’ve had to visually design a concept for a navigation menu for one of my personal projects, Blight of the Rose, a 2D horror side scroller before I could write it in code. In the games industry a programmer works closely with producers and other departments such as game designers, artists and animators to translate the project’s vision into the final game product (Stefyn, 2020), in my case I have created the artwork myself to not only improve my art skills but to help me visually understand what I have to write in code.</b></p>

As a games programmer I have used a few of these methods to assist in generating creative ideas. A first example of a creative technique I have used is a mind map, a tool that captures thinking inside your head helping you think, collect knowledge, remember and create ideas (SimpleMind, 2021), I have used this method to help generate ideas on what video game I want to develop and the various features it should include. Secondly, a mash up is a collaborative idea generation method where concepts are combined to create something new and possibly unexpected (Hyper Island, 2021). I have used mash ups to assist in deciding on an art style when combined with a game genre when generating games concepts. </b></p>

In July 2021 in an article by (Stuart, 2021) they state that the CEO of Sony made an interesting announcement, that the company will be collaborating with PlayStation developers to create intelligent computer controlled characters. He then went on to state that <i>“Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning in which an AI effectively teaches itself how to act through trial and error. In short, these characters will mimic human players. To some extent, they will think.”</i>. This explains that artificial intelligence in video games is about to get smarter and AI learning capabilities have expanded quickly.&nbsp; In one the video games I am developing there are plans to implement AI in my enemy units, albeit I have not gotten to the stage where I must write my AI but articles like this give me inspiration and want to further my knowledge in AI to make my game enemies smart like the ones stated by (Stuart, 2021).</b></p>

A games jam is for teams to come together and make a video game, non-digital game or card game where participants design and inject new ideas to grow the global games industry (Global Game Jam, 2018). A hackathon is an event usually hosted by tech companies or organizations where participants come together to collaborate on a project often without sleep to achieve their task in a competition style event (Rasmussen University, 2021). The results are the same for both events, to develop a new innovative product. There are techniques that will aid in the productivity and idea generation of a rapid ideation event and by the end of this week I will put these techniques into practice ready for future game jam and hackathon events.&nbsp;</b></p>

I use this method whenever an idea comes to mind, I note it down using the application and as a smartphone user I usually have the device in my possession most of the time.

I use this environment to test the various systems I have written in C# such as my menu system and player movement. I also have a prototype of the player animation on a sprite sheet that I am using as a placeholder asset to build upon the movement system before final art is used. </b></p>

There are a couple that I would like to enter. The first is the Global Game Jam that starts 28th January every year and one location that is hosted is Falmouth, the location of my course. The event lasts 2 days until the 30th of January where the participants are given 48 hours to create a video game using rapid ideation. Global games jam details are located on their website at https://globalgamejam.org/ where it shows the locations it is hosted at.<br><br>Another games jam that I am interested in is the Pirate Jam which takes place on a fleet of sailing boats at Thailand. The games development takes place on beach bars along their sailing routes for 5 hours a day for 7 days. This rapid ideation event is hosted annually and there has been 4 events that has taken place so far. As of this year the event is closed due to the Covid-19 global pandemic. The event is supported by Epic Games and other various companies. The website is at http://www.pirate-jam.com/ where more details about the games jam can be found.&nbsp;</b></p>

I have chosen to make a 2D game in the Unity engine and writing the scripts in the C# programming language.<br><br>I have chosen to recreate the arcade game ‘Stacker’ which is featured on arcade machines in pubs and arcades and recreate it into video game to be accessible on android mobile devices. Choosing to recreate Stacker will be beneficial for me as a games developer as I will improve my skills as a programmer in the aspect of gameplay programming. The reason that I have chosen this arcade game to recreate is because in 2015 I released a game on the Google Play store called Dash and Stack that I developed with a co-developer and as of 2021 it has been removed from the store due to its low API version.&nbsp;<br><br>Dash and Stack is an android arcade game that recreates Stacker with game mode twists such as the classic mode, and endless mode and many more. I have since made plans to remake the game in higher definition targeting higher API android devices to republish and I have been given the full go ahead by my previous co-developer to create every aspect of the game including the gameplay that I did not write in the original release.&nbsp;</b></p>

The rules of the game are the player must stack blocks and reach the top of the grid without losing all of them. Depending on the position of the player the game will set the maximum number of blocks and movement speed. For my game this is called Classic Mode as it retains all the rules of the original arcade game but to put a twist on the classic mode, I have created a game mode called Endless where the player can endlessly stack blocks and increase a counter so they can achieve a high score. I have made this mode as its generally considered bad practice to copy a game in its entirety so to make my game unique I had to put at twist on the existing formula for players to find an interest in the game.</b></p>

I think that instead of having it this way the speed should gradually increase making the game increasingly difficult the more the player stacks a block.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, due to time constraints I did not manage to match up the lives of the blocks to those on the game menu and this is another element that I would like to change going forward.
