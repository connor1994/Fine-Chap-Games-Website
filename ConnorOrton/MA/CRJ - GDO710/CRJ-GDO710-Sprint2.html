To define agile <i>“Agile methodology is based on iterative development with which requirements and solutions evolve through collaborative effort.”</i> (Stern, 2017) and there are several benefits to using this methodology. To highlight a few examples of why agile is beneficial for video game development, firstly, agile projects finish on time which benefits teams that struggle with time constraints. Secondly, agile projects deliver high quality products results without inefficiencies or bugs in code. Lastly, code built by agile teams is well constructed and maintainable (Stellman and Greene, 2014).<br><br>For my first game project I will use the Kanban methodology using the website Trello. To define Kanban, <i>“Kanban is a method for process improvement used by agile teams. Teams that use Kanban start by understanding the way that they currently build software, and make improvements to it over time.”</i> (Stellman and Greene, 2014) and I will use Trello to manage the various mechanics I will have to write and implement and bullet point any improvements or suggestions I can make to existing mechanics or for future consideration.</b></p>

I decided on a tower defense game for a couple of reasons, firstly because I can create a level that is small and static, the other genres will require a dynamic background, and this would take too much time on the development process and secondly, I haven’t had experience with creating a 2D tower defense game and it would be beneficial for me as a programmer to write some original scripts to know how the genre operates.

In the games industry workers must constantly adapt to changing conditions, develop knowledge and remaking themselves to uncertainty. Critical reflection provides the theory and process to enable these changes to happen and manage them more effectively (Fook and Gardner, 2007).</b></p>

Reflective practice can also help you to develop creative thinking skills, and encourages active engagement in work processes.”</i> (SkillsYouNeed, 2021) During my time on the course, I have realized the importance of reflection and how it affects myself as a game’s developer. Learning from my mistakes and being self-critical will make me a better games programmer by ensuring I write the most efficient and readable code possible to be successful in a future career as a programmer.<br><br>Since the start of the course, I have already improved my specialism as a programmer as I have created a tower defense game for android for my first rapid ideation project, a genre that I wasn’t previously familiar with and did not have any plans on developing in the foreseeable future. I am happy with the standard of the result, and I have learned how to write more efficient and readable code in the process. Also, the course has made me write more effectively in a reflective aspect by writing this blog. Being reflective has also had a benefit when I write code as I often criticize myself wondering if what I have wrote is the most effective way of solving my issue at the time.</b></p>

It could involve listening, negotiation, problem solving, decision making and assertiveness to another person’s opinions.&nbsp;<br><br>Cognitive domain&nbsp;<br>The cognitive domain will determine the strengths and weaknesses of the learning process and will state goals for future development.&nbsp;<br><br>Procedural domain&nbsp;<br>The procedural domain is about assessing current skills and identifying any improvements that are needed for the learning process. I have reviewed my previous blog posts and created a chart where each domain was used in my reflective writing.&nbsp;</b></p>

These results make sense to me as firstly, the results from the cognitive domain show that I have been identifying my strengths, weaknesses, and future goals especially when developing my various game projects, to compliment this the procedural domain results show that I have been reflecting on my failures and stating where there is room for improvement with my projects. Affectively speaking, the results from this domain show that I have involved my feelings with my posts, most commonly stating how I feel about the results of my work and sometimes regarding the time scale I must complete certain tasks which links to the disposition domain. Lastly, the lack of interpersonal domain results show that I haven’t been interacting with others or listening to other people’s opinions as much as I should which concern me, and this is an area that I should improve on going forward in the course.</b></p>
