To define agile <i>“Agile methodology is based on iterative development with which requirements and solutions evolve through collaborative effort.”</i> (Stern, 2017) and there are several benefits to using this methodology. To highlight a few examples of why agile is beneficial for video game development, firstly, agile projects finish on time which benefits teams that struggle with time constraints. Secondly, agile projects deliver high quality products results without inefficiencies or bugs in code. Lastly, code built by agile teams is well constructed and maintainable (Stellman and Greene, 2014).<br><br>For my first game project I will use the Kanban methodology using the website Trello. To define Kanban, <i>“Kanban is a method for process improvement used by agile teams. Teams that use Kanban start by understanding the way that they currently build software, and make improvements to it over time.”</i> (Stellman and Greene, 2014) and I will use Trello to manage the various mechanics I will have to write and implement and bullet point any improvements or suggestions I can make to existing mechanics or for future consideration.</b></p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary my-2">I wrote a build menu which is used to create the tower bases and weapons. I decided to have the menu appear next to the tower foundation and flip depending on where it is located on the screen as sometimes it will appear out of the boundaries. This made me learn a valuable lesson about keeping user interface elements in the screen boundaries especially on mobile devices.</p>

When programming, creating scriptable objects and public databases are standard in my methodology as it is an efficient way of storing data and reading from it so that I don’t have to manually write out new objects in code from scratch which would take up unnecessary time.</p>
