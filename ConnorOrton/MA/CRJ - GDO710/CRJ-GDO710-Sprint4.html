Because my course was 3D oriented and there was a very little programming learning influence, so I gave myself a project with high scope to learn at a greater depth.<br><br>I decided to create an asset pack that recreates the Pokémon franchises game mechanics using unreal blueprint visual scripting. Examples of a few types of game mechanics I had to recreate were the following:<br>- Dialogue System, the ability to interact with NPCs around the testing area.&nbsp;<br>- Combat System, the ability to fight enemy NPCs in a battle system scenario.&nbsp;<br>- Shop System, the ability to purchase and sell items from NPCs.&nbsp;<br>- Menu System, the ability to manage the player’s creature team, use items, change options and more.&nbsp;<br><br>I was successful in completing this assignment on time by using an Agile project management methodology. To manage my project, just like my two rapid ideation projects I used a Trello, a website for creating a Kanban board which manages various tasks that I had to carry out. I would refer to my Kanban board daily and update my tasks accordingly depending on if they are finished, to do or removed. Kanban has provided the games industry with predictability, transparency and optimization, making it easier to develop complex games without too much stress or overspending on budget (IBQMI, 2021). Going forward into the course I will continue to use a Kanban methodology for all my future game projects as I work the most efficiently whilst keeping focussed and motivated.</b></p>

Firstly, logo design is important as it has to be memorable, striking and representative of what the company stands for.

Finally, customer personas must be created using a combination of demographic and psychographic information to allow for a clear picture of the target audience to use in marketing (TheLogoCompany, 2021).</b></p>

          <p class="text-left p-2 bg-primary my-2"><b>I have created my own brand for my games development practice which I call Fine Chap Games, my indie game company consisting of myself, a programmer, and my partner Natalie Smith, an artist, and together we develop video games. I have chosen the name Fine Chap Games for a few reasons. Firstly, the words ‘Fine Chap’ represents a gentleman individual from 1950s England dressed in a suit, pipe, top hat and so on and this theme has been reflected on this website which is why the colour scheme is grey to resemble that era.<br><br>I chose this theme as we are English developers and are proud to be English people and of our heritage. Seeing a man dressed up in a gentleman attire nowadays can come across as humorous and we took this into consideration when choosing our brand to say that although we are serious about developing video games there will always be that aspect of a humour in our video games as we want our games to be fun, relaxing, and laid back. We have created a company logo to reflect these aspects of our brand. </b></p>

Assuming I have creative freedom over the game I am meant to develop, over the next few weeks I will consider what game type of game I will create and possibly get a head start on developing the design concept to be ready for development.<br><br>Regarding my final project, I do have a game in mind that I would like to develop. Before enrolling on the course, I have been developing a 2D pixel art horror platformer called Blight of the Rose which I have already created a few systems for and most of the user interface. The game is medium in scale, it is not a large project nor is it a small project. I emailed my tutor regarding continuing the development of this game for my course assignments and they advised me to create new projects over the duration of the course and I should be tactical in the systems and features that I develop so that I can translate these into Blight of the Rose in the future.<br><br>This has been great advice which I have been utilizing, for example I have learned how to create a combat system from the result of my first rapid ideation game and I know how to create parallax backgrounds for a 2D platformer out of the result of my second rapid ideation game. With this all being said I am considering restarting Blight of The Rose as I have learned new programming techniques from the time starting the project until now and I don’t believe what I have written is efficient code and there are better ways of writing it.
