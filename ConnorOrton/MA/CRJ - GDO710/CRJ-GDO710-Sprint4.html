Because my course was 3D oriented and there was a very little programming learning influence, so I gave myself a project with high scope to learn at a greater depth.<br><br>I decided to create an asset pack that recreates the Pokémon franchises game mechanics using unreal blueprint visual scripting. Examples of a few types of game mechanics I had to recreate were the following:<br>- Dialogue System, the ability to interact with NPCs around the testing area.&nbsp;<br>- Combat System, the ability to fight enemy NPCs in a battle system scenario.&nbsp;<br>- Shop System, the ability to purchase and sell items from NPCs.&nbsp;<br>- Menu System, the ability to manage the player’s creature team, use items, change options and more.&nbsp;<br><br>I was successful in completing this assignment on time by using an Agile project management methodology. To manage my project, just like my two rapid ideation projects I used a Trello, a website for creating a Kanban board which manages various tasks that I had to carry out. I would refer to my Kanban board daily and update my tasks accordingly depending on if they are finished, to do or removed. Kanban has provided the games industry with predictability, transparency and optimization, making it easier to develop complex games without too much stress or overspending on budget (IBQMI, 2021). Going forward into the course I will continue to use a Kanban methodology for all my future game projects as I work the most efficiently whilst keeping focussed and motivated.</b></p>

Firstly, logo design is important as it has to be memorable, striking and representative of what the company stands for. Secondly, a company must have a good slogan and tag line which must be short and memorable. Finally, customer personas must be created using a combination of demographic and psychographic information to allow for a clear picture of the target audience to use in marketing (TheLogoCompany, 2021).</b></p>

I have chosen the name Fine Chap Games for a few reasons. Firstly, the words ‘Fine Chap’ represents a gentleman individual from 1950s England dressed in a suit, pipe, top hat and so on and this theme has been reflected on this website which is why the colour scheme is grey to resemble that era.<br><br>I chose this theme as we are English developers and are proud to be English people and of our heritage. Seeing a man dressed up in a gentleman attire nowadays can come across as humorous and we took this into consideration when choosing our brand to say that although we are serious about developing video games there will always be that aspect of a humour in our video games as we want our games to be fun, relaxing, and laid back. We have created a company logo to reflect these aspects of our brand. </b></p>

Assuming I have creative freedom over the game I am meant to develop, over the next few weeks I will consider what game type of game I will create and possibly get a head start on developing the design concept to be ready for development.<br><br>Regarding my final project, I do have a game in mind that I would like to develop. Before enrolling on the course, I have been developing a 2D pixel art horror platformer called Blight of the Rose which I have already created a few systems for and most of the user interface. The game is medium in scale, it is not a large project nor is it a small project. I emailed my tutor regarding continuing the development of this game for my course assignments and they advised me to create new projects over the duration of the course and I should be tactical in the systems and features that I develop so that I can translate these into Blight of the Rose in the future.<br><br>This has been great advice which I have been utilizing, for example I have learned how to create a combat system from the result of my first rapid ideation game and I know how to create parallax backgrounds for a 2D platformer out of the result of my second rapid ideation game. With this all being said I am considering restarting Blight of The Rose as I have learned new programming techniques from the time starting the project until now and I don’t believe what I have written is efficient code and there are better ways of writing it.

          <p class="text-left bg-primary p-2 mb-2" style=""><b>Hi there everyone, my name is Connor Orton BSc, I’m an aspiring games designer and programmer from the UK studying an indie games production MA. Throughout this video I’ll reflect on what I’ve learned and accomplished throughout my first module.&nbsp;<br><br>The first sprint focussed on creativity, rapid ideation and prototyping. From this sprint I learned the following:&nbsp;</b><br><b>• Exploiting playfulness as a tool for fostering creativity and innovation (Bateson and Martin, 2013).&nbsp;<br>• Understanding that creative art and design is an iterative process which is improved, optimized and polished over time to be observed again for new aspects, to refresh opportunities and for problem-solving (Petrra Tomekova, 2021).&nbsp;<br>• Video game prototyping has benefits which include functionality and interactions, saving time and costs and involved user feedback (Trista Liu, 2017).&nbsp;<br>• How to reverse engineer and create an arcade game prototype that utilizes unity coroutines, instantiation and grid-based movement.&nbsp;<br><br>The second sprint focussed on time management and the importance of reflection. During this sprint I gained the following insights:&nbsp;<br>• What game jams are available and their benefits such as they teach specific skills to develop a game and you can gain insight on the entire collaborative development process in an active learning environment (Fowler et al., 2016).<br>• When working in a game development team there should be regular reflection sessions to assess how to become more effective and then after adjust the team’s behaviour accordingly (Babb, Hoda and Norbjerg, 2014).&nbsp;<br>• I have been reflective regarding my strengths, weaknesses and future goals but I lack in communicating with others.&nbsp;<br><br>The third sprint focussed on version control, research, and communities of practice. I developed the understanding of the following:&nbsp;<br>• Version control and its importance regarding game projects to help manage projects and ensure there are no unintended human error and consequences (Gaba, 2021).&nbsp;<br>• Ethics concerns must be considered when conducting user research such as informed consent, confidentiality and anonymity, identification and non-traceability, responsibilities and more (Cohen, 2018).&nbsp;<br>• Become aware of communities of practice and how it is a good idea to attend a conference for networking opportunities as networking is fundamental for getting a job (Miguel Otero-Iglesias, 2019).&nbsp;<br><br>The final sprint aimed to teach me about agile practice, career opportunities and future thinking. I learned the following:&nbsp;<br>• Understanding agile practices and the envisioning process and how to apply it when developing video games to produce a product vision, enough details to understand customers, features and high-level solutions and an idea of the product budget (Innolution LLC, 2021).<br>• Utilized the Real WORKS short course to help me gain employment and to properly format my CV.&nbsp;<br>• Concluded what went well, not so well and suggestions for improvement for the first module.&nbsp;<br><br>For my first rapid ideation session I developed a 2D tower defense game for pc and android devices after the theme was announced by live webinar featuring a dixit card showing a child and a dragon. I improved my project management abilities by using Trello, an online Kanban board website. I learned several things in the process such Unity game engine experience, C# code efficiency, user interface design, enemy spawning, simple path finding, database class implementation and more. For this project I felt that there was little that went wrong and the only improvement I could suggest was the balancing the gameplay as I felt the game was too easy to complete.&nbsp;<br><br>For my second rapid ideation session after choosing the COP26 summit theme I created a 2D platformer game with a pixel art style featuring a cat who must survive in a world devastated by climate change. I again utilized Trello to improve my project management skills to ease my workload. This project didn’t go as well as I planned as I didn’t manage to implement any puzzle solving gameplay as my time was focussed more on writing my player controller class. I also spent too much time creating the background art assets using Aseprite. If I was to do the game again, I would spend less time on the artwork, add less features to the player controller and focus on the gameplay aspect of the game instead. Regardless of the result, I improved my unity game engine experience, C# code efficiency, how to write a featureful player controller and how to implement dynamic 2D environments.&nbsp;<br><br>To improve my learning process, I must research and develop on the following:&nbsp;<br>• How to balance video game difficulties by reading books and looking into other developer’s insights on how they solved the issue to better my own game projects.&nbsp;<br>• How to appropriate project scope in limited time challenges by participating in game jams or mini projects to create a playable prototype.&nbsp;<br>• How to use other game engines and learn new programming languages to broaden my skillset by learning from books and online courses.&nbsp;<br>• How to better communicate and network with others by utilizing social media and by posting on the forums to improve my communication skills to prepare for group projects.&nbsp;<br><br>Collaborating with others can create a synergy in which a much better game can be created instead of an individual working alone (David, 1997) and I have formulated these two SMART goals because of this:&nbsp;<br><br>1. I will advance my team working skills so that I can work more effectively in a team which will improve my coordination and social skills to ready me for employment, I will do this by completing tasks that can be completed in a group and I will do this before the end of the course.&nbsp;</b><br><br><b>2. I will interact with fellow students to improve my social skills so that I can speak to people easier and be more ready for interviews at games companies. I will do this by replying to posts on the forums and using the discord group to socialize with others and I will do this multiple times before the end of the course.&nbsp;<br><br>It would benefit my skillset to learn the C++ programming language as most job roles require this (Jason W. Bay, 2021). I’ll also utilize another game engine such as Unreal Engine to familiarize myself further with industry standard software. These topics of study would open up several career opportunities in the future so I’ve created these smart goals to support this:&nbsp;</b><br><br><b>3. I will improve my skills in C++ so I can apply for more job opportunities at games companies to assist me in building a career with a wide skillset, I will do this by developing a game in the Unreal Engine and writing in C++ and I will do this at least once before the end of the course.</b><br><b>&nbsp;<br>4. I will develop my games engines skillset further by using another game engine to develop another video game to open career opportunities in the future. I will do this at least once before the end of the course.&nbsp;</b></p>
